Write a program that determines whether a given  number is prime.Explore different ways to implement this check and consider efficiency for larger numbers.


Algorithm
1.Declare a function that takes in a number(n) as a parameter.
2.Iterate from zero up to the square root of the number (n).
3.For each number in the iteration check if the input is divisible by number(n).
4.If a divisor is found then is not prime, if a divisor is found then n is a prime number.
